link between two assets
-----------------------

E.g. you have a catalog "companies" and a catalog "locations".
There is company "Alpha"
There is location "Alpha Head Quarter"
You want to link the "Alpha Head Quarter" as a child of the Alpha company.
Open 2 tabs
- one with the asset for the company
- one with the asset for the location
peek the #number of the location in the title. E.g. "Asset #7: Alpha Head Quarter"

In the company tab, choose "Links" in the action Menu.
Enter the following in the "Children:" field: "asset:7" (sans quotes)
save.

It should then expand into "Asset #7: Alpha Head Quarter" in the left pane, under "children".

You could also do the inverse and add the company as a parent to the location.
